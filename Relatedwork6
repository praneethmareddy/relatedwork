\section{Related Work}
Service Function Chain (SFC) placement has been extensively studied in 5G and Beyond-5G (B5G) networks, focusing on optimizing reliability, latency, and resource efficiency. Traditional approaches use Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimize cost and bandwidth consumption while meeting Quality of Service (QoS) constraints [1]. However, these centralized methods suffer from high computational complexity and fail to scale in large network deployments.

To address computational challenges, heuristic-based methods have been proposed to provide near-optimal solutions with reduced complexity [2]. These methods attempt to allocate VNFs efficiently while satisfying latency and resource constraints. While heuristics improve real-time decision-making, they often lead to suboptimal VNF placement, affecting network performance in dynamic environments.

To enhance scalability, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches such as SCHE2MA introduced multi-agent RL to distribute placement decisions across multiple domains [3]. SCHE2MA also incorporated an auction-based migration mechanism to balance workload and energy consumption. However, RL-based models require extensive training, lack generalization to unseen network conditions, and introduce overhead due to frequent VNF migrations.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as AI-driven alternatives for SFC placement, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Maximal Weight Matching (MWM) in [5]. GCN-based approaches efficiently model network topologies and predict optimal VNF placements in real time, eliminating the need for continuous retraining. Unlike RL-based models, GCNs generalize better to new network scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead. However, they require large datasets for training and do not explicitly consider energy efficiency.

Reliability-aware SFC placement has also gained attention, particularly in softwarized 5G networks. The work in [6] introduced an ILP-based model for optimal placement while ensuring service reliability, delay constraints, and resource efficiency. The proposed approach uses SFC subchaining to improve reliability without relying on redundant backups. If subchaining alone does not meet reliability thresholds, selective VNF backups are introduced instead of full-chain redundancy, minimizing resource usage. The authors develop an ILP optimization model that minimizes the number of active physical nodes while satisfying reliability and latency constraints. Given the high computational complexity of ILP, a stable matching algorithm is proposed to provide near-optimal solutions efficiently. This approach significantly reduces redundancy costs while ensuring service continuity. However, ILP remains computationally expensive for large-scale deployments, requiring heuristic approximations.

The proposed Extensible Constraint-Aware Pipeline (ECAP) builds upon AI-driven advancements and reliability-aware models by introducing an adaptive orchestrator designed to optimize latency, resource efficiency, and service reliability across 2Gâ€“6G networks. Unlike existing methods, ECAP integrates constraint-aware ILP formulations with AI-based decision-making, ensuring scalable SFC placement across heterogeneous network generations. Additionally, ECAP employs resource-aware allocation mechanisms to ensure optimal deployment paths while maintaining flexibility through an extensible plug-in architecture.
