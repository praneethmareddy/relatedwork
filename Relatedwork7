\section{Related Work}
The concept of Service Function Chaining (SFC) placement has evolved significantly, beginning with foundational models like Distributed Service Function Chaining (DSFC) and advancing to optimization-based, heuristic, and AI-driven approaches.

Distributed Service Function Chaining (DSFC) was one of the first approaches to distribute VNFs across multiple physical machines instead of placing them on a single server \cite{paper7}. Unlike conventional SFC models that assume all VNFs in a chain must be deployed on the same node, DSFC enables dynamic VNF placement across multiple servers to enhance scalability, resource utilization, and throughput. This approach eliminates bottlenecks caused by single-node SFC deployment and ensures traffic is routed optimally across multiple servers. DSFC is formulated as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) problem to minimize overall cost, subject to resource and bandwidth constraints. To address computational complexity, Kariz, a heuristic algorithm, was proposed to iteratively optimize VNF placement and routing. DSFC has proven effective in 5G networks, cloud security, and IoT, where dynamic and distributed VNF allocation is critical for handling large-scale traffic.

Following DSFC, later research focused on optimization-based techniques for centralized and hybrid SFC placement. Traditional Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Integer Linear Programming (ILP) models were developed to minimize deployment costs and resource consumption while satisfying Quality of Service (QoS) constraints \cite{paper1}. However, these centralized approaches suffer from high computational complexity and poor scalability in large networks.

To address these computational challenges, heuristic-based methods were introduced to provide near-optimal solutions with lower complexity \cite{paper2}. These approaches attempt to allocate VNFs efficiently while ensuring low-latency SFC placement. While heuristics improve real-time decision-making, they often lead to suboptimal resource allocation, impacting network performance under dynamic traffic loads.

To enhance scalability, reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, such as SCHE2MA, introduced multi-agent RL models to distribute placement decisions across multiple domains \cite{paper3}. SCHE2MA also incorporates auction-based migration mechanisms to balance workload and minimize energy consumption. However, RL-based models require extensive training datasets, struggle with real-time adaptability, and introduce high computational overhead due to frequent VNF migrations.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as AI-driven alternatives for SFC placement optimization, such as the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Maximal Weight Matching (MWM) in \cite{paper5}. GCN-based approaches efficiently model network topologies as graphs and predict optimal VNF placements in real time, eliminating the need for continuous retraining. Unlike RL-based models, GCN-based approaches generalize better to new network scenarios and significantly reduce computational overhead. However, they require large labeled datasets for training and do not explicitly consider energy efficiency.

Reliability-aware SFC placement has also gained attention, particularly in softwarized 5G networks. The work in \cite{paper6} introduced an ILP-based model for optimal placement while ensuring service reliability, delay constraints, and resource efficiency. The proposed approach uses SFC subchaining to improve reliability without full redundancy. If subchaining alone does not meet reliability thresholds, selective VNF backups are introduced instead of full-chain redundancy, minimizing resource consumption. Given the high computational complexity of ILP, a stable matching algorithm was proposed to provide near-optimal solutions efficiently. While this approach reduces redundancy costs while ensuring service continuity, ILP remains computationally expensive for large-scale SFC deployments.

The proposed Extensible Constraint-Aware Pipeline (ECAP) builds upon AI-driven advancements, distributed SFC models, and reliability-aware placement strategies by introducing an adaptive orchestrator designed to optimize latency, resource efficiency, and service reliability across 2Gâ€“6G networks. Unlike existing methods, ECAP integrates constraint-aware ILP formulations with AI-based decision-making, ensuring scalable SFC placement across heterogeneous network generations. Additionally, ECAP employs resource-aware allocation mechanisms to ensure optimal deployment paths while maintaining flexibility through an extensible plug-in architecture.
