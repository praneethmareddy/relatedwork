\section{Related Work}

Service Function Chain (SFC) placement in Data Center Networks (DCNs) is a critical challenge for optimizing **latency, resource allocation, and reliability**. Existing solutions include **heuristic**, **optimization-based**, and **AI-driven** methods, but they lack **adaptive, scalable, and automated** frameworks for multi-generation (2G–6G) networks.

Early research applied **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** for latency-aware placement \cite{paper1}, but its computational complexity led to heuristic alternatives. These approaches reduced overhead but failed to adapt to real-time network variations. **Mobility-aware MILP models** \cite{paper2} improved handover efficiency but remained computationally expensive. **Network slicing strategies** \cite{paper3} enhanced 5G traffic management but lacked generalization for **2G–6G** scenarios.

Recent studies emphasize scalability and reliability in SFC placement. **Santos et al.** \cite{paper6} reviewed distributed SFC scenarios, stressing the need for dynamic solutions. **Li et al.** \cite{paper7} introduced a high-availability and resource-efficient placement framework, demonstrating improvements in **resilience and resource utilization**. AI-driven **Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)** \cite{paper5} offer dynamic adaptation but lack **fine-grained microservice configuration**. Meanwhile, **Distributed SFC models** \cite{paper4} improve scalability but overlook **real-time traffic variations**.

Our proposed **LLM-assisted Constraint-Aware Pipeline (CAP)** introduces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item **Adaptive microservice placement** using **SARIMA** for predictive traffic-aware optimization.
    \item **Automated configuration generation** via LLMs, reducing manual intervention and errors.
    \item **Multi-dimensional cost optimization**, incorporating **latency, QoS, and energy efficiency**.
    \item **Modular framework** integrating **CSPF for path selection** and a **resource collector** for real-time monitoring.
\end{itemize}
Our approach aligns with IEEE GLOBECOM 2025’s theme of **"Sustainable Communications for Ubiquitous Intelligence"**, leveraging AI-driven **automation and predictive analytics** for scalable **SFC placement** across 2G–6G networks.
